# Reinforcement learning on snake-game

## What is this repo?
This repo inspired by patrick loeber's snake game reinforcement learning. This repo simply covers fundamentals of reinforcement learning e.g. bellman equation, Q-value neural net. Currently the agent can not realize Its body, this issue will be handled soon. 

As you can see, after almost 100 games, it can achieve scores of 30s even 40s. However the big issue is the state structure does not include snake's own body coordinates. This issue will be handled in the future versions, I guess :P.
